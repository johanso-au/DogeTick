Pebble Watch Face

This is a fork of +/u/nbash Warhol_Coin project (http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1s6jcf/all_the_important_information/ and https://github.com/nbash/Warhol_Coin)

Presenting current weather, forecast (with icons), Bitcoin price and Dogecoin price on the one watchface. Auto updates approx every 5 mins. Requires HTTPebble for your phone (various apps are available to provide this). Compiled PBW app is available from http://small.cat/can (random shortlink... I have nothing to do with small cats or cans)

Note: the download link may go bad (not sure is I can link straight from the online IDE), so let me know an I'll host it somewhere else.

The Watchface is hard coded with my VPS address and API key to get the data (at the end of main.h), so any donations to assist with Forecast.io costs is greatly appreciated (DUNqYPputM8ZLHTHM6RCpNcVs326wWWTkM)

Any questions or comments welcomed.
