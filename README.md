Pebble Watch Face

This is a fork of +/u/nbash Warhol_Coin project (http://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/1s6jcf/all_the_important_information/ and https://github.com/nbash/Warhol_Coin)

Presenting current weather, forecast (with icons), Bitcoin price and Dogecoin price on the one watchface. Auto updates approx every 5 mins. Requires HTTPebble for your phone (various apps are available to provide this). Compiled PBW app is available from http://small.cat/can (random shortlink... I have nothing to do with small cats or cans)

Note: the download link may go bad (not sure is I can link straight from the online IDE), so let me know an I'll host it somewhere else.

The Watchface is hard coded with my VPS address and API key to get the data (at the end of main.h), so any donations to assist with Forecast.io costs is greatly appreciated (DUNqYPputM8ZLHTHM6RCpNcVs326wWWTkM)

Any questions or comments welcomed.


How to install:
=======

Ok, first... you've got your pebble connected to your phone? I'm assuming yes. If not, check the pebble site for more info.

Next, you will need an app on you phone to enable something called HTTPebble.

For Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lukekorth.httpebble
For Apple: https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/httpebble/id650174711?mt=8

Download and install the one for your phone. Run it once. You can close it after that.
Next, download the watchface. To do this, you will need to click the following link on the phone you have Pebble connected to and the Pebble official app installed on. This will bring up the pebble app and start the download to your watch.

Now, once that watchface is installed, cycle through your watchfaces on the Pebble till you get to the one that looks like mine in the photo. Note: it will not have any numbers filled in - This is normal.
Now, give it a minute or two to sync, and you will see the numbers filled in.
Done. the numbers will self update every few minutes.
Enjoy!
